New "Maril√π" and at the same time new robot "-", codes and projects,
for 2020-2021 junior robocup competitions, maze category.

The design of the second robot was born from the idea of completely changing hardwere,
making it more modular and adding new features such as suspensions,
also thanks to the collaboration with Sisma, manufacturer of resin 3d printers,
with which I was able to print the robot chassis with a new material.

The software and sensors have also had an update from the previous year,
we have moved from ir distance sensors to lasers,
we have mounted an incremental encoder on all motors so that we can create a pid controller for speed,
we have built new limit switches, a new release system for rescue kits and much more.

But due to the "coronavirus" we were unable to participate in all the competitions of 2020.
